How to find high dividend ETF and stock?
  There are 1601 ETF and 6765 stock as of 2015-10-14.
  Not all securities provide dividend. So brute force attack is not efficient.
  
  1) Collect last 3 years dividend data of all ETF and stock.
     And find out securities that generate periodical securities.
     Above are candidates.
  2) Get dividend of last 10 years
